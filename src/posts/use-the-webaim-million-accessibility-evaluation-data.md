The [WebAIM million](https://webaim.org/projects/million/) is a yearly and thorough accessibility report. It uses [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/standalone) to analyze the home pages of the top 1,000,000 websites.

It is a valuable data collection that we can learn from and use daily.

- Knowing what the frequent and easily measurable accessible errors are is a valuable feature.
- Getting a picture of the generic state of a11y through the WCAG errors is also helpful.

Seeing the low WCAG conformance status is unfortunate, but still information. Caring about a11y can be a competitive advantage and protect us from lawsuits. We can present this data to the stakeholders and push for more inclusivity.

The automatic tools catch simple errors, and the good thing is that these are usually easily fixable (relatively) and can make a huge difference.
