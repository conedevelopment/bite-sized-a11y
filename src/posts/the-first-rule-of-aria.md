The Accessible Rich Internet Applications specification is a powerful tool that can help us tackle the accessible problems on the web.

It is quite complicated, hard to master, and easy to miss or overuse. For this reason, we always have to remember the first rule of ARIA:

**If there is a built-in, native HTML element or attribute that already does the same thing you want to use ARIA (through re-purposing an element) for, then use the native solution.**

Following this principle, you can save yourself from a lot of headaches. There is rarely a universal solution, so testing is as necessary as any other time.
