- [Form Design Patterns](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/printed-books/form-design-patterns/) - The forms are the core elements of the interactive web. Everybody wants to build better and more accessible ones; with this practical book, you can make them too.

- [Inclusive Components](https://book.inclusive-components.design/) - Similar to the Inclusive Design Patterns book but focuses more on components from the same author.
- [Practical Web Inclusion and Accessibility: A Comprehensive Guide to Access Needs](https://inclusive.guide/) - A practical book approaching accessibility from per disability. An excellent second book.
