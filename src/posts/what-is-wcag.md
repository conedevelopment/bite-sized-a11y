The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is an extensive standard for web development; right now, its current version is 2.1. It is an essential piece of guideline both for specialists and users.

The **WCAG version 2.1** has 13 guidelines with many success criteria distributed among three levels to help you create more accessible web-based products. The levels are: **A** is the easiest, the **AA** is the most suggested goal, and the **AAA** is the most strict.

It has four main principles (named POUR):

- **Perceivable:** the content must be accessible to everyone.
- **Operable:** the functionality must work on different user inputs (mouse, keyboard).
- **Understandable:** must be easily understandable (content, structure, functionality).
- **Robust:** the result must function on different technologies (like screen readers).

Keep in mind that WCAG is just a tool to make accessibility measurable. If you are WCAG compliant, it still (usually) doesn't mean that you are 100% barrier-free.
